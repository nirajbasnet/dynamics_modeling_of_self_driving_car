1. Read the demo python script. Its super simple to understand.
2. If you want to train your own model, please check out lines 10-90 of the training python script. You can change the hyperpramaeters and the neural network structure itself.
3. Similar things for the RNN code. It takes 12 sequences of action + observation data to give the latest state and next state.
